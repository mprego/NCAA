Plan for NCAA model:

get data for all games
	first check through kaggle
	otherwise i need to scrape from cbbreference and just get the box scores.  didn't i do this lat year?
	just want data for top 50ish teams
	
Calculate stats from game data
	get season wide data 
	get last 5 games (but if i use this i need to continue using this for the model, which will make it very complicated)
	
Then i want to use the regular season's data as a training set for a svm or random forest model (do i make a different model for each team? if so, maybe i'll get data for last 2 years)
	i need to learn how to extract the probabilities from these
	then i'll put bracket into model with win probabilities to get a monte carlo simulation
	collect stats on msot likely teams on each bracket line
